# Finding a user's UID, GUID etc.

Use `id <user>` e.g.

```
# id bensnap
uid=502(bensnap) gid=503(bensnap) groups=503(bensnap),10(wheel)
```

You can use `id -g`, `id -u` and `id -G` to output the user's GUID, UID and groups respectively.

You can also inspect `/cat/etc/passwd`:

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep <user>
bensnap:x:502:503:bensnap:/home/bensnap:/bin/bash
```
