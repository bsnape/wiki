# Certificate Authorities
*overview here*

There are two types of CAs: intermediate and root.

# Intermediate Certificates



# SSL Termination & Pass-through

# Certificate extensions

* .pem – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
* .cer, .crt, .der – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see .pem above)
* .p7b, .p7c – PKCS#7 SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or CRL(s)
* .p12 – PKCS#12, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)
* .pfx – PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in IIS)

# Convert DER to PEM

```
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem
```

# Certificate (chain) information

```
$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <host>:<port>
```
