# Logging managers

There are various logging managers for Linux.

- `syslog` - the default log manager for various distros. Light but not very flexible. Config is stored in `/etc/syslog.conf`.
- `rsyslog` - uses the same config file style (`/etc/rsyslog.conf`) but is more advanced than `syslog` with more options.
- `syslog-ng` - like `syslog` but more object-oriented.
- `journalctl`?
