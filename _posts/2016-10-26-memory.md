# OOM killer

# swap

Swap is...

You can disable swap with `swapoff -a` and re-enable with `swapon -a`.

You would typically not have swap enabled in a cloud environment as it makes more
sense to scale up the instance size (and RAM) rather than use swap space.

# Useful commands



## `free`

Running `free -m` provides you with memory statistics:

```
# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          3831       2266       1565          0        110        801
-/+ buffers/cache:       1354       2477
Swap:         1635        449       1186
```

Here we can see that

`free -m`

## `vmstat`

## `top`

(shift + m)
